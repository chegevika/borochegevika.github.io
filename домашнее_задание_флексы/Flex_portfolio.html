                            Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ‚úçÔ∏è at my blog.
                            
                            In my free time you can find me longboarding üõπ , at the gym üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, at the beach üèñ or on tech meetups and conferences around Ukraine and Europe.

                    As a Lead Front End Engineer, one of my main tasks was to mentor coworkers of my team, contributing to their personal and professional growth. I worked very close to stakeholders to define, organise and breakdown new projects. One of the biggest challenges I faced with my team was to migrate the ulabox.com website to a new business model while refactoring the entire technology stack to Next.js and React. We had to integrate this pivot into the Ulabox application too. I've worked with the logistics team to build Android applications with React-Native for our supply chain and dark stores.

                <h4>As a Front End Engineer I contributed to the development and release of the native Ulabox application. The application is built with React-Native and is available on iOS and Android. I worked on automating the process of shipping our applications to the stores using Fastlane and Travis-CI. Also I contributed to the maintenance of our website, that was built on top of Symfony using Twig, SCSS and JavaScript.</h4>
